# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 30, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our application.

## Information Collection and Use

This application interacts with Instagram's API to retrieve messages sent through Instagram Direct via webhook. The application processes and stores only the **text of messages**, without associating them with the sender’s name, date, or any other identifiers.

The collected message text is stored in our **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system **exclusively for internal business purposes**, such as managing customer inquiries and improving communication processes. We do not use this data for any other purposes, nor do we share it with third parties.

### What Data We Do Collect
- **Text of messages**: Only the content of messages received via Instagram Direct is processed and stored.
- We do **not** store names, dates, or any metadata related to the sender.

## Data Storage and Security

All processed messages are stored in our CRM system for internal business use. We implement security measures to protect stored data from unauthorized access. No message content is shared with third parties, except when required by law.

## Third-Party Services

This application utilizes **Instagram’s API** to retrieve Direct Messages via webhook. Instagram’s API may have its own privacy policy, which you should review. We do not share or transmit any data to external services beyond the necessary interaction with Instagram.

## Data Retention

We retain the text of messages in our CRM for as long as necessary for internal business operations. If you wish to request the deletion of stored messages, please contact us.

## User Rights

Since our application does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (such as names, dates, or contact details), there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. However, we do store **message text** received through Instagram Direct for internal business purposes.

If you wish to request the deletion of stored message text, please contact us. For inquiries regarding your personal data or interactions with Instagram, please refer to [Instagram’s Privacy Policy](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy).
