# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 30, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our application.

## Information Collection and Use

This application interacts with Instagram's API to retrieve messages sent through Instagram Direct via webhook. We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) of users.

The data processed by this application is solely for the purpose of receiving messages sent via Instagram Direct and transmitting them to the webhook. No data is stored or retained after the message is processed.

### What Data We Do Collect
- **Messages**: Only messages sent through Instagram Direct are processed and passed through the webhook.
- **Metadata**: We do not collect metadata (e.g., message sender details, timestamps) unless directly provided through the webhook.

## Data Storage and Security

We do not store any personal data on our servers. All processed data is passed through the webhook in real time and is not saved beyond that.

Our system is designed to operate with minimal access to user data, ensuring the privacy and security of the data transmitted via Instagram Direct.

## Third-Party Services

This application utilizes **Instagram’s API** to retrieve Direct Messages via webhook. Instagram’s API may have its own privacy policy, which you should review. We do not share or transmit any data to third-party services beyond what is necessary for interacting with Instagram’s platform.

## Data Retention

As stated, no personal data is retained by us. All messages are processed in real time and discarded once transmitted via the webhook.

## User Rights

Since our application does not collect any personal information directly, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. For inquiries regarding your data or interactions with Instagram, you should refer to Instagram’s Privacy Policy.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data handling practices, feel free to contact us at:

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
